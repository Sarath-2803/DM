1.1

 Determine whether each of these conditional statements
is true or false.
a) If 1 + 1 = 2, then 2 + 2 = 5.
b) If 1 + 1 = 3, then 2 + 2 = 4.
c) If 1 + 1 = 3, then 2 + 2 = 5.
d) If monkeys can fly, then 1 + 1 = 3

pigeon hole

Show that for every integer n there is a multiple of n that has only 0s and 1s in its decimal
expansion.

THE GENERALIZED PIGEONHOLE PRINCIPLE 

If N objects are placed into k
boxes, then there is at least one box containing at least ⌈N∕k⌉ objects

What is the minimum number of students required in a discrete mathematics class to be sure
that at least six will receive the same grade, if there are five possible grades, A, B, C, D, and F

a) How many cards must be selected from a standard deck of 52 cards to guarantee that at least
three cards of the same suit are selected?
b) How many must be selected from a standard deck of 52 cards to guarantee that at least three
hearts are selected?

Suppose that a computer science laboratory has 15 workstations and 10 servers. A cable can be
used to directly connect a workstation to a server. For each server, only one direct connection to
that server can be active at any time. We want to guarantee that at any time any set of 10 or fewer
workstations can simultaneously access different servers via direct connections. Although we
could do this by connecting every workstation directly to every server (using 150 connections),
what is the minimum number of direct connections needed to achieve this goal?

 Assume that in a group of six people, each pair of individuals consists of two friends or two
enemies. Show that there are either three mutual friends or three mutual enemies in the group.

Undergraduate students at a college belong to one of four
groups depending on the year in which they are expected
to graduate. Each student must choose one of 21 differ-
ent majors. How many students are needed to assure that
there are two students expected to graduate in the same
year who have the same major---------------

There are six professors teaching the introductory discrete mathematics class at a university. The same final exam is given by all six professors. If the lowest possible score on the final is 0 and the highest possible score is 100, how many students must there be to guarantee that there are two students with the same professor who earned the same final examination score

-------------How many ordered pairs of integers (a, b) are
needed to guarantee that there are two ordered pairs
(a1, b1 ) and (a2, b2 ) such that a1 mod 5 = a2 mod 5
and b1 mod 5 = b2 mod 5--------------------

uppose that every student in a discrete mathematics
class of 25 students is a freshman, a sophomore, or a
junior.
a) Show that there are at least nine freshmen, at least
nine sophomores, or at least nine juniors in the class.
b) Show that there are either at least three freshmen, at
least 19 sophomores, or at least five juniors in the
class
