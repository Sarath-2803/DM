is true or false.
a) If 1 + 1 = 2, then 2 + 2 = 5.
b) If 1 + 1 = 3, then 2 + 2 = 4.
c) If 1 + 1 = 3, then 2 + 2 = 5.

expansion.

THE GENERALIZED PIGEONHOLE PRINCIPLE 

If N objects are placed into k
boxes, then there is at least one box containing at least ⌈N∕k⌉ objects

What is the minimum number of students required in a discrete mathematics class to be sure
that at least six will receive the same grade, if there are five possible grades, A, B, C, D, and F

a) How many cards must be selected from a standard deck of 52 cards to guarantee that at least
three cards of the same suit are selected?
b) How many must be selected from a standard deck of 52 cards to guarantee that at least three
hearts are selected?

Suppose that a computer science laboratory has 15 workstations and 10 servers. A cable can be
used to directly connect a workstation to a server. For each server, only one direct connection to
that server can be active at any time. We want to guarantee that at any time any set of 10 or fewer
workstations can simultaneously access different servers via direct connections. Although we
could do this by connecting every workstation directly to every server (using 150 connections),
what is the minimum number of direct connections needed to achieve this goal?

 Assume that in a group of six people, each pair of individuals consists of two friends or two
enemies. Show that there are either three mutual friends or three mutual enemies in the group.

Undergraduate students at a college belong to one of four
groups depending on the year in which they are expected
to graduate. Each student must choose one of 21 differ-
ent majors. How many students are needed to assure that
there are two students expected to graduate in the same
year who have the same major---------------

There are six professors teaching the introductory discrete mathematics class at a university. The same final exam is given by all six professors. If the lowest possible score on the final is 0 and the highest possible score is 100, how many students must there be to guarantee that there are two students with the same professor who earned the same final examination score

-------------How many ordered pairs of integers (a, b) are
needed to guarantee that there are two ordered pairs
(a1, b1 ) and (a2, b2 ) such that a1 mod 5 = a2 mod 5
and b1 mod 5 = b2 mod 5--------------------

uppose that every student in a discrete mathematics
class of 25 students is a freshman, a sophomore, or a
junior.
a) Show that there are at least nine freshmen, at least
nine sophomores, or at least nine juniors in the class.
b) Show that there are either at least three freshmen, at
least 19 sophomores, or at least five juniors in the
class

There are 38 different time periods during which classes
at a university can be scheduled. If there are 677 different
classes, how many different rooms will be needed?

. Assuming that no one has more than 1,000,000 hairs on
their head and that the population of New York City was
8,537,673 in 2016, show there had to be at least nine peo-
ple in New York City in 2016 with the same number of
hairs on their heads.

 Show that there are at least six people in California (pop-
ulation: 39 million) with the same three initials who were
born on the same day of the year (but not necessarily in
the same year). Assume that everyone has three initials.

A computer network consists of six computers. Each
computer is directly connected to at least one of the other
computers. Show that there are at least two computers in
the network that are directly connected to the same num-
ber of other computers.

A computer network consists of six computers. Each
computer is directly connected to zero or more of the
other computers. Show that there are at least two com-
puters in the network that are directly connected to the
same number of other computers. [Hint: It is impossible
to have a computer linked to none of the others and a
computer linked to all the others.]


 Find the least number of cables required to connect eight
computers to four printers to guarantee that for every
choice of four of the eight computers, these four com-
puters can directly access four different printers. Justify
your answer

Prove that at a party where there are at least two people,
there are two people who know the same number of other
people there

. An arm wrestler is the champion for a period of 75 hours.
(Here, by an hour, we mean a period starting from an ex-
act hour, such as 1 P. M ., until the next hour.) The arm
wrestler had at least one match an hour, but no more than
125 total matches. Show that there is a period of consec-
utive hours during which the arm wrestler had exactly 24
matches

There are 51 houses on a street. Each house has an ad-
dress between 1000 and 1099, inclusive. Show that at
least two houses have addresses that are consecutive in-
tegers.


-----------propositional-------------

State the converse, contrapositive, and inverse of each of
these conditional statements.
a) If it snows today, I will ski tomorrow.
b) I come to class whenever there is going to be a quiz.
c) A positive integer is a prime only if it has no divisors
other than 1 and itself.

 For each of these sentences, state what the sentence
means if the logical connective or is an inclusive or (that
is, a disjunction) versus an exclusive or. Which of these
meanings of or do you think is intended?
a) To take discrete mathematics, you must have taken
calculus or a course in computer science.
b) When you buy a new car from Acme Motor Company,
you get $2000 back in cash or a 2% car loan.
c) Dinner for two includes two items from column A or
three items from column B.

“You can edit a protected Wikipedia entry” and a: “You
are an administrator.”

mother” as a logical expression involving predicates, quantifiers with a domain consisting of all
people, and logical connectives.
