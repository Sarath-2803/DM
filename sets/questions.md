Prove that P(A) ⊆ P(B) if and only if A ⊆ B

Prove or disprove that if A and B are sets, then P(A × B) = P(A) × P(B)  -F (counter eg)

Demorgan proof

Show that if A and B are sets in a universe U then A ⊆ B
if and only if A ∪ B = U

Let A, B, and C be sets. Show that
a) (A ∪ B) ⊆ (A ∪ B ∪ C).
b) (A ∩ B ∩ C) ⊆ (A ∩ B).
c) (A − B) − C ⊆ A − C.
d) (A − C) ∩ (C − B) = ∅.
e) (B − A) ∪ (C − A) = (B ∪ C) − A

 Show that if A and B are sets, then
a) A − B = A ∩ B.
b) (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ B) = A

to shows set a=b ,show a and b are each others subset

Let A and B be subsets of a universal set U. Show that
A ⊆ B if and only if B ⊆ A.

Let A and B be subsets of a universal set U. Show that A ⊆ B if and only if B ⊆ A

Prove or disprove that for all sets A, B, and C, we have
a) A × (B ∪ C) = (A × B) ∪ (A × C).
b) A × (B ∩ C) = (A × B) ∩ (A × C)

. Prove or disprove that for all sets A, B, and C, we have
a) A × (B − C) = (A × B) − (A × C).
b) A × (B ∪ C) = A × (B ∪ C) ----####--------------

Show that if A is an infinite set, then whenever B is a set, A ∪ B is also an infinite set

------------------Functions 2.3------------------

#f(x)=+-something is not a function bcs it has two images

Why is f not a function from R to R if
a) f (x) = 1∕x?
b) f (x) = √x?
c) f (x) = ±√(x2 + 1)?


---------Relation------------------

A relation can be used to express a one-to-many relationship between the elements of the
sets A and B (as in Example 2), where an element of A may be related to more than one element
of B. A function represents a relation where exactly one element of B is related to each element
of A.



----------fun-----------

determine whether it is a fun
domain and range
if fun is one one,onto
strictly increasing,dec
