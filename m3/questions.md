Let P(n) be the statement that a postage of n cents can be
formed using just 3-cent stamps and 5-cent stamps. The
parts of this exercise outline a strong induction proof that
P(n) is true for all integers n ≥ 8.
a) Show that the statements P(8), P(9), and P(10) are
true, completing the basis step of a proof by strong
induction that P(n) is true for all integers n ≥ 8.
b) What is the inductive hypothesis of a proof by strong
induction that P(n) is true for all integers n ≥ 8?
c) What do you need to prove in the inductive step of
a proof by strong induction that P(n) is true for all
integers n ≥ 8?
d) Complete the inductive step for k ≥ 10.
e) Explain why these steps show that P(n) is true when-
ever n ≥ 8.

a) Determine which amounts of postage can be formed
using just 4-cent and 11-cent stamps.
b) Prove your answer to (a) using the principle of math-
ematical induction. Be sure to state explicitly your
inductive hypothesis in the inductive step.
c) Prove your answer to (a) using strong induction. How
does the inductive hypothesis in this proof differ from
that in the inductive hypothesis for a proof using
mathematical induction?

This is a Frobenius coin problem with two relatively prime integers (4 and 11 are coprime). The largest amount not representable with such coin types is:
Largest amount not formable=(4⋅11)−4−11=44−4−11=29
Largest amount not formable=(4⋅11)−4−11=44−4−11=29​

So:

    All amounts ≥ 30 cents can be formed using 4-cent and 11-cent stamps.

    Some amounts < 30 cents cannot be formed.


Suppose that a store offers gift certificates in denomina-
tions of 25 dollars and 40 dollars. Determine the possible
total amounts you can form using these gift certificates.
